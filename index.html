            <p class="paragraph">
                The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 17 SDGs are integrated they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.
            </p>
            <p>
                The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context.
