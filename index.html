            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 17 SDGs are integrated they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.
            </p>
            <p>
                The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context.

            <h2>Sustainable Goals And India</h2>
            <p>
                The Government of India established the NITI Aayog to attain sustainable development goals. In March 2018 Haryana became the
                first state in India to have its annual budget focused on the attainment of SDG with a 3-year action plan and a 7-year strategy 
                plan to implement sustainable development goals when Captain Abhimanyu, Finance Minister of Government of Haryana, unveiled a
                &#8377;1,151,980 lakh (equivalent to &#8377;130 billion, US$1.6 billion or &#8364;1.6 billion in 2020) annual 2018-19 budget. Also, NITI Aayog 
                starts the exercise of measuring India and its States progress towards the SDGs for 2030, culminating in the development of the 
                first SDG India Index - Baseline Report 2018

            <h2>Why Sustainable Goals matter!</h2>
            <p>
                The beauty of the goals is that everyone can contribute, and every contribution, small or big, will make an impact on our world. In our
                 industry, we have seen how the goals have shaped the business environment, and for the better. The Paris Agreement alone has helped open 
                 up US$ 23 trillion in business opportunities for emerging markets for climate-smart investments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working primarily in developing and transitional countries, we see the impact, both the negative impact of the changing environment and 
                the growing inequality, but also the positive impact of the goals and how they are helping create better opportunities for the local 
                communities. We have to use this momentum and keep pushing towards achieving the goals, so we can create a better world for us all.
            </p>

            <h2>Gender Equality</h2>
            <p>
                Organizations worldwide are increasing their efforts to help achieve the goals. Especially SDGs referring directly to economic growth,
                 sustainable industrialization, innovation and sustainable production have attracted a lot of attention within major industries. But
                  lately, SDGs aimed towards improving human rights have garnered more attention as well.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Lately, we have started seeing a project specific focus on gender equality, where there is a need for applying practices to reduce 
                inequality. Reducing inequality has always been an important part of our work because we work in the local communities and we see how
                 important it is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gender inequality is unmistakably one of the biggest obstacles to overcome poverty because it subjects women to discrimination which,
                 in many cultures, results in denial of rights to education, to positions of power, and any real voice in decision-making in the society.
                  Breaking inequality is pivotal, and I think we will see rapid improvement within science, politics and business when we successfully
                   include more women.

                Climate Change
            </h2>
            <p>
                Goal 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It is intrinsically linked to all 16 of the other Goals of
                 the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To address climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement to limit global
                  temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
            </p>
            <p>
                limate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, 
                costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p>
                People are experiencing the significant impacts of climate change, which include changing weather patterns, rising sea level,
                 and more extreme weather events. The greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are driving climate change and continue 
                 to rise. They are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the worldâ€™s average surface temperature is projected to 
                 rise over the 21st century and is likely to surpass 3 degrees Celsius this century with some areas of the world expected to warm
                  even more. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.

            <h2>
                Quality Education
            </h2>
            <p>
                Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to escaping poverty. Over the past decade, major progress was made towards 
                increasing access to education and school enrollment rates at all levels, particularly for girls. Nevertheless, about 260 million children 
                were still out of school in 2018  nearly one fifth of the global population in that age group. And more than half of all children and 
                adolescents worldwide are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe, a majority of countries announced the temporary closure of schools, impacting
                 more than 91 per cent of students worldwide. By April 2020, close to 1.6 billion children and youth were out of school. And nearly 369 
                 million children who rely on school meals needed to look to other sources for daily nutrition. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Never before have so many children been out of school at the same time, disrupting learning and upending lives, especially the most vulnerable
                 and marginalised. The global pandemic has far-reaching consequences that may jeopardize hard won gains made in improving global education.

            <h2>
                No Poverty
            </h2>
            <p>
                Globally, the number of people living in extreme poverty declined from 36 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2015. But the pace of change is
                 decelerating and the COVID-19 crisis risks reversing decades of progress in the fight against poverty. New research published by the UNU 
                 World Institute for Development Economics Research warns that the economic fallout from the global pandemic could increase global poverty 
                 by as much as half a billion people, or 8% of the total human population. This would be the first time that poverty has increased globally 
                 in thirty years, since 1990.
            </p>
            <p>
                More than 700 million people, or 10 per cent of the world population, still live in extreme poverty today, struggling to fulfil the most basic 
                needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few. The majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live 
                in sub-Saharan Africa. Worldwide, the poverty rate in rural areas is 17.2 per cent more than three times higher than in urban areas. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For those who work, having a job does not guarantee a decent living. In fact, 8 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide 
                lived in extreme poverty in 2018. One out of five children live in extreme poverty. Ensuring social protection for all children and other 
                vulnerable groups is critical to reduce poverty.
